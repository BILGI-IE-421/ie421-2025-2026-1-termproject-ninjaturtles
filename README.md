# IE 421 - Data Science for Engineers Term Project

## NYC Citi Bike: Mobility, Logistics & Environmental Impact

New York City Bike Share system generates large-scale trip data that reflects urban mobility behavior across different times and locations. In this project, we aim to analyze how users’ movement patterns change depending on the time of day and the day of the week, and how these patterns are spatially distributed during peak traffic hours. By aggregating monthly trip data, spatial density maps will be created to identify the most crowded areas and time periods within the city. In addition, inflow and outflow volumes at each station will be compared to determine logistical imbalances in the system. Stations with consistently higher inflows will be identified as sinks with excessive bicycle accumulation, while those with higher outflows will be classified as sources experiencing persistent shortages. Furthermore, using historical monthly data on total trips, total distance traveled, and avoided carbon emissions, a multiple linear regression analysis will be conducted to statistically explain the relationship between system usage and carbon emission savings. Based on this model, future carbon emission reductions provided by the bike share system will be estimated, offering insights into its potential environmental impact in the coming months.
